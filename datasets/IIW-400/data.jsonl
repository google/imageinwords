The figure's body is depicted by a tilted rectangle, suggesting forward motion, with a circle for the head positioned directly above, implying alertness or attention in the direction of movement. A single white line extends from the upper left of the rectangle, bending at a right angle to represent an arm, while a similar line on the lower right depicts a bent leg, emphasizing the dynamic nature of the symbol. Although the limbs are rendered in a somewhat abstract manner, their positioning supports the overall impression of the figure propelling the wheelchair to the right. Encasing the blue square is a border in a yellow-orange hue, creating a vibrant contrast against the black asphalt, which aids in the visibility of the symbol. The yellow border is not perfectly smooth, but has a rugged texture, providing tactile feedback and possibly contributing to non-slip properties. The sunlight casts subtle shadows across the symbol, suggesting either a midday or an afternoon time when the photo was taken, with the light source positioned almost directly above.

The panels have beveled edges, adding depth and shadow to the door's facade. The top two panels are slightly elongated compared to the two below them. The door's color is a muted olive or greyish-green, showing signs of age and wear, with paint that seems to have faded and chipped over time, revealing layers and possibly the bare material along the edges and at spots on the panels.\n\nThe door hardware consists of a metallic doorknob and a keyhole, both located toward the left edge and suggesting a left-hand opening configuration. The knob is positioned on the central horizontal axis and is tarnished, with its surface reflecting little light, indicating it might be made of brass or a similarly oxidizable material. Directly beneath the knob is a keyhole, also appearing weathered, hinting at the door's antiquity and possibly compromised functionality. No key is visible, and there is no escutcheon plate framing the keyhole, leaving the lock mechanism partially exposed to elements and wear.\n\nThe door frame is obscured on the left side of the image by a partial view of another wall perpendicular to the door, which appears to be painted in a light, contrasting color. The door's threshold is not visible, but a small strip of weather stripping or a door sweep is seen at the bottom, attached to the door, likely to seal against drafts. The surrounding wall is white, painted or plastered over with a light color that shows similar signs of wear and age as the door, with some areas where the underlying material is peeking through. The top of the doorway is framed by a horizontal lintel, which appears straight and flush with the wall.\n\nAmbient lighting casts soft shadows in the recesses of the door panels and along the right side of the door, indicating a light source from the upper left of the frame, although the source itself is not visible in the image.

The sculpture is of a human man, who seems to be in a standing position with his left arm across his chest and the right arm hanging by his side. The sculptured man appears to be wearing a draped garment reminiscent of classical attire, suggesting an influence of Greco-Roman style in their depiction. This clothing style is highlighted by the folds and creases artistically carved into the material of the sculpture.\u00a0\n\nThe sculpture is framed by a rectangular stone or concrete outline that sets it into the building's facade. Beneath the figure, there is an additional sculptural element featuring what appears to be a small goat with horns. The goat\u2019s head is also stylistically rendered, with discernible details such as eyes, nostrils, and ears, adding a mythological or symbolic dimension to the piece. Below the goat\u2019s head, there is another object that resembles a bowl or a type of shallow container resting on a pedestal.\n\nThe building itself presents a clean, modern architectural style with smooth walls and linear elements. The section of the wall visible in the photo has a light, somewhat mottled texture and color, likely from the natural variations in the stone or the painting technique used. A series of tall, vertically oriented windows with dark frames punctuates the wall, reflecting a functional design ethos. The windows have slightly projected sills and lintels, and the nearest window features a yellow-pulled blind, contrasting with the rest of the building's muted color palette.\u00a0\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it may have been taken during the day, with sunlight illuminating the building's facade from the side, casting soft shadows that accentuate the texture and depth of the architectural and sculptural elements.

Its message \"IT'S OK\" uses a medium-sized, vertically aligned font that sits atop the smaller, also vertical \"TO HAVE TOO MUCH,\" which in turn precedes \"FUN\" in a significantly larger typeface.

Its base is crafted from a lighter colored wood, creating a subtle but noticeable contrast.
